Q. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
A. 
1. Security 
2. Clarity (easy to read)
3. Approachability (easy to learn)
4. Developer Friendly (easy to debug)
5. Resource Oriented 

Q.In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
A. 
1. Security - prevents malicious actors from impacting other users. Gives people trust in the code & transactions that run on the blockchain 
2. Clarity - makes it easier to understand what is being executed, and to reuse code, integrate with etc.
3. Approachability - a developer network is better with more people coding in its ecosystem. If the language is easy to learn (approachable), then more developers are likely to use it.
4. Developer friendly - same answer as in #3 above :-) 
4. Resource oriented - makes code modular & reusable. REST baby!
